#About
This project will automatically display the starry sky relative to the user's latitude using starwheels made by Dominic Ford.

#To run python scripts:
activate virtualenv with:
  source ~/projects/environments/planisphere/bin/activate
deactivate virtualenv with:
  deactivate

imgPaths.json contains all latitudes and also a decimal number that is the ratio from the bottom of the holder image that the starwheel needs to center on.
