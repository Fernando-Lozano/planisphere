Todo:
  make website functional:
    choose some basic colors
    allow for swiping to turn the planisphere
    after inactivity re-align the planisphere
    add option to change latitude and display current latitude

  remove green circle in images
  find desired color scheme
  output all latitudes of data
  revamp planisphere so that the viewing window is fully zoomed in.

  clean up code

Idea:
  Right now I have the point where the starwheel needs to center highlighted in green.
  I think I will find the hight of the green circle relative to the hight of that image, and center the starwheel image to that.
