Todo:
  make website functional:
    find the aspect ratio of holder
    make canvas with that aspect ratio
    display holder and wheel in canvas
    find out how planisphere is suppose to work
    use current user data and time and location to line up planisphere
    allow for swiping to turn the planisphere
    after inactivity re-align the planisphere

  remove green circle in images
  find desired color scheme
  output all latitudes of data

Idea:
  Right now I have the point where the starwheel needs to center highlighted in green.
  I think I will find the hight of the green circle relative to the hight of that image, and center the starwheel image to that.
