Todo:
  make website functional:
    fix starwheel date lining up with correc hour
    allow for swiping to turn the planisphere
    after inactivity re-align the planisphere
    add option to change latitude and display current latitude

  remove green circle in images
  find desired color scheme
  output all latitudes of data

Idea:
  Right now I have the point where the starwheel needs to center highlighted in green.
  I think I will find the hight of the green circle relative to the hight of that image, and center the starwheel image to that.

  Once it is fully functioning, I think I will have only the window displayed on the webiste and size everything to the starwheel(Much easier aproach for preserving aspect ratios I think).
