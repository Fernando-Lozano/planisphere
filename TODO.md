Todo:
  add circle to top half of holder
  remove lower half content of holder
  get relative numbers for image(print jsObject for now)
  display image on website
  Once functioning:
    change imageMaker to not print bottom half of fold
    remove bottom text in image maker
    print all latitudes
    output a JSON for all relative numbers

Idea:
  Right now I have the point where the starwheel needs to center highlighted in green.
  I think I will find the hight of the green circle relative to the hight of that image, and center the starwheel image to that.
  I will need to print out a json data structure(learn python json module) of the relative heights of where the starwheel needs to be placed.
